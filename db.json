The Inscription Wall, in Washington DC, lets the visitor browse the quotes without the structure of a timeline—the earliest quote dates to 1956 and the Montgomery Bus Boycott; the most recent is taken from Dr. King's sermon at the National Cathedral in Washington just four days before he was assassinated.","date":"20230116","url":"https://cn.bing.com/th?id=OHR.InscriptionWall_EN-US1392173431_UHD.jpg"},{"title":"Aura River in Turku, Finland","caption":"Aura River in Turku, Finland","description":"The Turku Cathedral rises above the frosted forests near the mouth of the Aura River, which runs through the middle of Turku, Finland.","date":"20230115","url":"https://cn.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Turku_EN-US1258814703_UHD.jpg"},{"title":"Domestic donkey feeding on cherry twigs","caption":"Feast of the Donkey","description":"This fuzzy donkey feeding on the leaves of a cherry tree probably doesn't know that today was once celebrated as the Feast of the Donkey. We think any day is a good day to celebrate donkeys. They've carried the load for humans for more than 7,000 years, so let's give them some love. More than 40 million donkeys do the heavy lifting around the world today, with 11 million in China alone.","date":"20230114","url":"https://cn.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DonkeyFeast_EN-US1153850805_UHD.jpg"},{"title":"Giant kelp in the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary, California","caption":"Giant kelp in the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary","description":"All along the Pacific Coast of North America, giant stands of kelp up to 100 feet high, like this one in California's Channel Islands, provide habitat for a vast number of fish, invertebrates, and sea mammals. Giant kelp, technically a type of brown algae, is the largest of all seaweed and one of the fastest-growing of any organism—as much as 2 feet per day! The gas-filled pods you see in this image help the kelp float. Like the trees in the Amazon, the kelp forests of our oceans are key to the health of marine life.","date":"20230113","url":"https://cn.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Pneumatocysts_EN-US1065729036_UHD.jpg"},{"title":"Rumelihisarı on the Bosporus Strait at Istanbul, Türkiye","caption":"Rumelihisarı in Istanbul, Türkiye","description":"Though Türkiye usually lives up to expectations as a warm Mediterranean country, snow occasionally falls here. This winter dusting of Istanbul, Türkiye's largest city, brings into sharper focus the lines of Rumelihisarı in the center of our image. The structure, also known as Rumeli Fortress, was built in the 15th century by an Ottoman sultan as a way to choke naval traffic through the narrow Bosporus Strait. The Bosporus connects the Sea of Marmara to the Black Sea, separating Istanbul into what are often referred to as its 'European side' and 'Asian side.' Today, the fortress isn't used to fire upon ships but serves as a museum and concert venue. While the place has changed over the centuries, the killer view hasn't.","date":"20230112","url":"https://cn.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RumeliHisari_EN-US4800002879_UHD.jpg"},{"title":"'Umschreibung,' a sculpture by artist Olafur Eliasson in Munich, Germany","caption":"'Umschreibung' by Olafur Eliasson in Munich","description":"Making a New Year's resolution to boost your fitness? Let us present National Take the Stairs Day. (You're welcome.) The annual event began informally in 2016 and was later adopted by the American Lung Association. It's an ingenious way to nudge people to exercise—most of us encounter stairs during our day, so there's really no excuse. Climbing stairs is a low-impact activity that raises your heart rate and burns calories.","date":"20230111","url":"https://cn.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Umschreibung_EN-US4693850900_UHD.jpg"},{"title":"Hummock ice on Lake Peipus in Estonia","caption":"Lake Peipus, Estonia","description":"Lake Peipus, the fifth-largest lake in Europe, dates back hundreds of millions of years to the Paleozoic Era and is known for its sand dunes, which can 'sing' when the wind blows just right. In the winter the frozen lake surface may feature ice hummocks, as seen in this image. The hummocks are caused by slow, uneven pressure in the ice pack.","date":"20230110","url":"https://cn.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HummockIce_EN-US4606231645_UHD.jpg"},{"title":"Breckenridge, Colorado","caption":"Breckenridge, Colorado","description":"Gold mining put this Rocky Mountain town on the map in the 1860s, but today the real gold is the powdery snow that falls liberally on the slopes that surround the town. Breckenridge is one of Colorado's premier ski and snowboard destinations. The resort has 35 lifts servicing five peaks and 2,900 acres of terrain. The visitors—who also arrive in the summer to fish, cycle, and paddle—easily outnumber the 5,000 residents of this quaint village. The gold mines have long shut down, apart from hosting visits from tourists. The enduring value of Breckenridge is its natural beauty.","date":"20230108","url":"https://cn.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Breckenridge_EN-US4460042968_UHD.jpg"},{"title":"Wool and mohair yarn","caption":"Yarn for Distaff Day","description":"We're showcasing gorgeous soft wool and mohair yarn because today is Distaff Day, a celebration that dates back to medieval times.

We're at Black Fell, which can be found in the Lake District of England. The term 'fell' originates from the Old Norse term for mountain, but it mostly applies to high, barren areas and, in the Lake District specifically, the area was usually uncultivated and used for grazing. Black Fell, which is a little over 1,000 feet high, has some acclaim, having been mentioned in Alfred Wainwright's 'Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells' as a prime viewing area. No matter which direction you gaze, you're sure to see something wonderful.","date":"20230106","url":"https://cn.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BlackFell_EN-US4276698070_UHD.jpg"},{"title":"Harbin International Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival, Harbin, China","caption":"Harbin International Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival, China","description":"The Harbin International Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival, in China's Heilongjiang province, begins today with all the spectacle and fanfare you'd expect from the world's largest festival of its kind. Big, bold, and beautiful, the event features more than 2,000 ice sculptures made from 240,000 cubic yards of ice collected by nearly a thousand workers from the nearby Songhua River. Many of the sculptures are illuminated with colored lights, creating a vibrant, glowing world of ice. It's estimated the colorful sights attract more than 18 million visitors each year. The event, which runs through late February, also features alpine skiing, cold water swimming in the aforementioned Songhua, as well as a festive ice lantern show.","date":"20230105","url":"https://cn.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HIISSF_EN-US4182845947_UHD.jpg"},{"title":"Earth as seen from the International Space Station","caption":"Earth at Perihelion","description":"We've reached perihelion! Two weeks after winter solstice the Earth's orbit is closer to the sun than at any other time of year—a result of the Earth's elliptical orbit. You may think, 'If we're so close to the sun, why can't I feel the heat?' Well, that's because we're only receiving about 7% more solar energy than normal, which doesn't really have much impact on the weather.","date":"20230104","url":"https://cn.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Perihelion_EN-US4106263162_UHD.jpg"},{"title":"Sandhill cranes, Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico","caption":"Sandhill cranes, Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge","description":"Hey, don't judge. Migrating takes it out of you! Yes, these sandhill cranes are sleeping on their feet in the waters of the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge in southern New Mexico. The birds start arriving around Halloween each year, and as many as 10,000 of them will stay to rest and feed in local fields until February. What's on the menu? Well, sandhill cranes aren't picky; they'll eat whatever's available, from plants and grains, to insects, snails, and even snakes. And they have plenty of avian company at this beautiful refuge each winter—whooping cranes, ducks, and snow geese from as far away as Alaska and Siberia also count Bosque del Apache as a favorite resting spot before heading north to their breeding grounds when the days get warmer. Thankfully, there's plenty of room to spread their wings at the 57,000-acre refuge.","date":"20230103","url":"https://cn.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SandhillSleeping_EN-US4023790571_UHD.jpg"},{"title":"Hohenzollern Castle, Germany","caption":"Hohenzollern Castle near Stuttgart, Germany","description":"For the charming Hohenzollern Castle, the third time really was the charm. Constructed on the top of Hohenzollern Mountain in the 11th century, the castle was largely ruined by a 10-month siege in 1423, only to be rebuilt a few decades later. It then served as an important strategic stronghold before again falling into disrepair. In the 19th century, King Frederick William IV of Prussia, best remembered for his commitment to building great works across Germany, had a new castle built on the grounds, replacing almost all the 15th-century construction. Today, Hohenzollern Castle is an open-air museum that hosts more than 350,000 visitors per year, making it one of the most-visited castles in Germany.","date":"20230102","url":"https://cn.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HohenzollernBurg_EN-US3949412118_UHD.jpg"}]
